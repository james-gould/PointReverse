# PointReverse
Simplest Javascript script to reverse a WGS84 coordinate from latitude/longitude to longitude/latitude.

Probably the simplest script I've ever written and put on the internet but it's useful when working with various GIS products that require differently formatted coordinates. This will not be maintained, this is only uploaded so I don't have to write it again when I'm on a new machine.
